Hi,

I've done many of my master's degree projects as a single project using my own engine:

[the-last-willy/school_id3d](https://github.com/the-last-willy/school_id3d)

Here's my own engine I used for them:

[the-last-willy/archived_22_abstractgl](https://github.com/the-last-willy/archived_22_abstractgl)

There should be some neat screenshots in these.

I've also done some cool stuff on Shadertoy:

[the-last-willy/shadertoy](https://github.com/the-last-willy/shadertoy)

And a game jam as well not so long ago (but there's no screenshots currently):

[the-last-willy/game_jam_22_07](https://github.com/the-last-willy/game_jam_22_07)

I have a bunch of other stuff but I didn't take the time to present it properly or it's not in very good shape.
They're in private but I would be happy to show them to anyone who asks.
Here's what some of the most finished ones are:
- A parser generator like ANTLR that doesn't work very well
- A small runner like game + it's own engine
- A 3D terrain generator based on a domain specific language
- A compile-time C++ implementation of general recursive functions
- A simulation of ants for finding the shortest path in a maze
- 2D game engine + Pacman in Java

I have an empty website as well. Soon tm it won't be empty anymore.
